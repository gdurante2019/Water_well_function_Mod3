There are 39 features in this dataset and three target classes (well status = ‘functional’, ‘non-functional’, or ‘functional; needs repair’).  Thus, this is a **multi-class classification problem.**\n",

    "___Findings:___ In this project, I found that there is a significant trade-off between 1) better overall test accuracy scores when using the original imbalanced class data, and 2) better performance in minimizing false negative errors by addressing class imbalances.  In fact, the problem with false negatives resulting from the use of imbalanced class data is so great that, for a model to be useful, the class imbalance issue _must_ be addressed.  To do this, I employed either SMOTE resampling or the class_weight='balanced' parameter (where available)."

Therefore, I developed functions that allowed me to aggregate smaller players into an \"other\" category based on a \"smaller-than-n\" value--e.g., if n=100, then the function would show the top 100 installers by number of wells, with the remaining installers (over 1900) aggregated into \"other installers\".

    "Of course, the \"best-performing\" model should predict _all_ wells correctly--'functional', 'non-functional', and 'functional--needs repairs'.  Developing a model that can accomplish this is challenging, however, because the percentages of these three types of wells--these three \"classes\"--are quite different (\"imbalanced\"):\n",

    "Machine learning models run with imbalanced classes often do a poor job accurately predicting the less abundant classes (non-functional and functional--needing repairs).  This is because the largest classes provide more data points during the 'learning' process, which tends to drive predictions towards the most common class (and away from the less common classes).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the most _common_ class is 'functional', but the most _important_ classes to identify are 'non-functional' and 'functional--needs repair'.  Thus, model results must be evaluated in the context of what models and parameters do the best job of accurately predicting non-functional wells and wells needing repairs, AND minimizing the number of failing wells incorrectly labeled as functional."

Because it's more important for failing wells to be correctly identified as failing--so that they get prompt attention--than it is for functional wells to be identified as functional. "

When imbalanced classes are not addressed, models tend to do poorly when predicting smaller classes (resulting in greater numbers of false negatives, for example); when imbalanced classes are addressed, overall accuracy seems to suffer.  There's a trade-off between higher accuracy scores and accurate prediction of smaller classes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "This project datasets includes almost 40 features, and some features (e.g., installer, funder) have over 2000 possible values.  This created lots of challenges for me as a student:  I was learning how to implement models using a number of different algorithms, while also having to figure out ways to make the modeling process more manageable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From a technical perspective, I used extensive EDA and data visualization to get a better understanding of the data and gain insights into which parameters were likely to be most important.  Developing custom functions to reduce the number of variables (top 'n' values in a feature) and automate some elements of the modeling also helped.  While this effort took a lot of effort, I think it was time well-spent in terms of developing my skills and increasing my understanding of, and intuition around, modeling parameters and approaches that are likely to yield better results for a particular situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I think that applying common sense when reviewing the model results is just as important as developing technical skills for more efficient data handling.  **Is the model actually doing a good job at predicting which wells are failing** (maximizing true positives and minimizing false negatives)?  Or is it just getting the highest accuracy but neglecting to minimize errors (such as predicting a non-functional well to be functional)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I was initially focused on the accuracy score (since this is what the DrivenData competition website outlines as an important metric), but as I started developing my models, I realized that the accuracy scores weren't telling me much about how well the models was doing at predicting failing wells.  I needed to dig deeper into the model results and started looking closely at the confusion matrices.  When I did this, I observed that models run without addressing class imbalances were doing a poor job at predicted failing wells.  I really internalized the fact that class imbalances can cause real problems with model predictions--and these errors can have real-life consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "I came to understand that there was a tradeof between high overall model accuracy and minimizing false negative errors.  By developing multiple iterations of models from different algorithms, I gained a more thorough understanding of these tradeofs and what kinds of adjustments would be most advantageous with similar types of data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having lots of skill at data visualization and manipulation is great, but these skills on their own will not automatically result in models that actually do a good job at what they are meant to do.  It is also necessary to think through the results and examine what's going on underneath the high-level scores and summary statistics."

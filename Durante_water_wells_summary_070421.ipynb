There are 39 features in this dataset and three target classes (well status = ‘functional’, ‘non-functional’, or ‘functional; needs repair’).

In fact, the problem with false negatives resulting from the use of imbalanced class data is so great that, for a model to be useful, the class imbalance issue _must_ be addressed.  To do this, I employed either SMOTE resampling or the class_weight='balanced' parameter (where available)."

Therefore, I developed functions that allowed me to aggregate smaller players into an \"other\" category based on a \"smaller-than-n\" value--e.g., if n=100, then the function would show the top 100 installers by number of wells, with the remaining installers (over 1900) aggregated into \"other installers\".  (This would also allow me to view how the wells of all of the remaining funders or installers performed, if I wished.) \n",

Such models identify only around 25% of all wells requiring repair or replacing--only ~2000 out of almost 8000--or a 75% false negative error!
